BeatOven was a project I did for the MIT Inspire's research competition.

It was an extremely fun event. Life changing. It was there that I discovered that I wanted to spend my time in college doing research.

Unfortunately this is a VERY early version of BeatOven. Therefore, the window is a pain to interface with, the beat only plays once, etc.

There are a lot of missing features from this version of BeatOven. Unfortunately this was the only version I could find in my email.

At this point it was simply a proof of concept. The artificial intelligence is still needed. If you'd like to pick up this project or perhaps work on it with me some, shoot me a message! I'd be happy to work with anyone who's interested or clean up the code base for them!
